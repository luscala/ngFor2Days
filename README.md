# ngFor2Days

It's a small set of notes for a two-days crash course on Angular.
The example project can be [edited on StackBlitz ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/edit/ngfor2days).

## Intro

1. Navigate to [angular.io](https://angular.io/), just to present the argument.
2. Move to the ["What is Angular?"](https://angular.io/guide/what-is-angular) and start discussing about the framework.

## Setup
It's time to setup the development environment!
  1. Install Node.js and a code editor.
  2. Install Angular CLI globally.
  ```bash
  npm install -g @angular/cli
  ````
  3. Create a brand new application with the CLI.
  ```bash
  ng new my-app
  ```
  4. Run `ng serve` and open the browser on `http://localhost:4200`: you'll see your first Angular application!
